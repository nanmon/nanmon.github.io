So here starts the [Jekyll]({{"https://www.jekyllrb.com"}}) blog adventure, I'll try to make the look better, although right now I don't know nothing about Jekyll yet. Or web development. In my plans are implementing the [Material Design Guide]({{"https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html"}}) and make some hack posts about what <del>I'm doing</del> I will be doing. :wq!
